## About
Nowadays, as we know, it is evident many people are in desperate need of some kind of help and some people want to help them, but the problem is that those who want to help are 
unable to provide help efficiently up to their desire due of lack of resources or some kind of platform through which they could be connected to the people who need any sort of 
help. As we can see, it's not only the human beings which are in desperate need of help, there are many stray animals thata are needed to be taken care of, so again the same 
problem still persists.

## Solution
Hence, as a solution to this issue, we will be creating a website which will provide a platform for the needy to get identified and helped by the people who want to help. It's 
an attempt to make society a better place to live. Our portal will be able to connect these people. The local NGOs and other organizations will create profiles on our portal 
and the users who want to help can register themselves as contributors.

There are many ways in which people can contribute to our portal:

* Food donation
* Clothes donation
* Blood donation
* Books donation for children

## Additional Features
* Volunteering for NGOs
* Acquiring a virtual pet
* Registered people can raise requests for seeking any kind of help from the platform or FHOO society.
* Contributors will be rewarded with **Virtual Medals** and names will be displayed on a leader board to motivate them as well as other people to contribute to the betterment 
of society.

## Tech Stack Used
* **Programming Languages -** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript 
* **Tools Used -** Figma, Adobe Illustrator

## What did we learn?
We learned a lot of things while working on this project:
* Time management
* Working as a team
* Utilising resources in an efficient way
* New concepts of programming
* Improved on our problem-solving skills
* Got to know about social issues, problems in the real world

## Challenges faced
* Difficulty in fixing errors and implementing some features of the website within this time crunch
